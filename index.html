        <h2 id="headline">About his life</h2>
        <p>Desmond Doss was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, to William Thomas Doss (1893-1989), a carpenter, and Bertha Edward Doss (née Oliver) (1899-1983), a homemaker and shoe factory worker. His mother raised him as a devout Seventh-day Adventist and instilled Sabbath-keeping, nonviolence, and a vegetarian lifestyle in his upbringing. He grew up in the Fairview Heights area of Lynchburg, Virginia, alongside his older sister Audrey and younger brother Harold.  </p>
       
       <p> Desmond Thomas Doss was a United States Army corporal who served as a combat medic with an infantry company in World War II. When Pearl Harbor was attacked, he was working at the Newport News Naval shipyard and could have requested a deferment—but he wanted to do more for his country. He was willing to risk his life on the front lines in order to preserve freedom. Doss refused to kill an enemy soldier or carry a weapon into combat because of his personal beliefs as a Seventh-day Adventist. He consequently became a medic assigned to the 2nd Platoon, Company B, 1st Battalion, 307th Infantry, 77th Infantry Division. </p>
        
        <p>While serving with his platoon in 1944 on Guam and the Philippines, he was awarded for exceptional valor in aiding wounded soldiers under fire. During the Battle of Okinawa, he saved the lives of 50-100 wounded infantrymen atop the area known by the 96th Division as the Hacksaw Ridge. Doss suffered a left arm fracture from a sniper's bullet while being carried back to Allied lines and at one point had seventeen pieces of shrapnel embedded in his body after a failed attempt at kicking a grenade away from him and his men.</p>
        <p>At the age of 87, Corporal Desmond Thomas Doss died on March 23, 2006, after being hospitalized with difficulty breathing. He is buried in the National Cemetery, Chattanooga, Tennessee.</p>
